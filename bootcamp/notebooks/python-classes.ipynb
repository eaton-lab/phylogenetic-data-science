    "Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language in which everything is based on objects. Every object can contain its own attributes (any type of data related to itself, either static or variable) and methods (any function that the object can perform). For example, as we saw before, a `list` is an object in Python, and it contains methods (such as `index`, `count`, `add`) that permit access or modify the information it has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are like an object constructor plan; they contain the instructions, properties, and methods we want to maintain in each object produced (instances). \n",
    "\n",
    "Creating custom classes is not fundamental to write a Python program. It is possible to write an entire program without using them. They are a design choice. Nonetheless, by implementing custom classes in your code, you will be able to write a more organized code and easier to use. Big projects may become unmanageable without the proper use of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom classes allow developers to define their own objects, entities containing valuable information that can be used by the object or by other parts of the program. In the following code snippets, we will learn how to define a class and show an example of the object it can produce."
