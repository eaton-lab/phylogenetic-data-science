    "Jupyter Notebooks are a powerful tool for interactively developing and presenting data science projects. They allow you to use a web browser (as opposed to a terminal or other software) to interact with a computer language interpreter (typically Python) to send commands and receive outputs. It then displays the outputs in HTML below the executed cells, and allows users to add rich text comments or annotations around code cells using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). "

First, we will use cloud-based instances of notebooks, like this one, to drop users into an environment that already has any software that they need installed. This is convenient for teaching since users do not need to spend time on setup. \n",

I encourage you to complete the *Coding Bootcamp* introduction which includes instructions for installing and runnign jupyter on your own computer, which will allow you to explore coding in Python greatly beyond the exercises in this textbook."

Markdown is much easier to learn and read than HTML, and for that reason has become a very popular tool for simple formatting and styling of text. To transform the cell back into *rendered text* you must *execute it*, which can be done by pressing the 'Run' button in the notebook tool bar while the cell is selected, or, by **holding down the control key and pressing enter (<kbd>ctrl+enter</kbd>)**. I strongly recommend that you learn and use the keyboard shortcut commands, since it will make you a more efficient notebook user. \n",

    "After executing the cell you should see it convert back into its *rendered* form, where Hello World will appear a bit larger than normal text, and bold.

To learn more about how to format text with Markdown you can find many tutorials online."

And that is the most common way that you will view notebooks. However, sometimes you may wish to just take a quick look at a notebook without having to start `jupyter`, and it turns out there are convenient ways to do that as well. The easiest way is to save your notebooks in a place like GitHub that automatically renders them to HTML for viewing. For example, this notebook is hosted on GitHub and can be viewed at this [GitHub link](https://github.com/eaton-lab/phylogenetic-data-science/blob/main/docs/bootcamp/notebooks/jupyter-intro.ipynb). Another popular option is the website *nbviewer.org*, which can accept any URI link to a publicly available .ipynb file, and it will render it to HTML. Here is an example of the same link above entered to [nbviewer.org](https://nbviewer.org/github/eaton-lab/phylogenetic-data-science/blob/main/docs/bootcamp/notebooks/jupyter-intro.ipynb)."
