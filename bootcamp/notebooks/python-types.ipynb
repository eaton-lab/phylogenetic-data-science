    "As a programming language, Python contains a set of core building blocks that are used to store and modify information to accomplish an amazing array of possible computational tasks. The most fundamental of these building blocks are the Python types. These are *objects* that can be created, with specific attributes and methods. You have seen several of these already. They include objects for storing boolean and numeric data, such as `bool`, `int` and `float`; objects for storing text data, such as `str` and `bytes`; objects for storing collections of objects, such as `list`, `tuple`; and hashed collections (more on this later), such as `set` and `dict`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these can be created by using the type name as a constructor function, which will return the object that can then be stored as a variable. Or, there is also a shortcut syntax to creating each of these types, such as the use of square brackets to create a list. A few examples of creating objects using either approach are shown below."

By contrast, the objects in a tuple are fixed, and can only be changed by creating a new tuple with a different collection of objects."

This library adds support to Python to manage very large and multidimensional arrays and multiple mathematical functions useful to operate on this type. This data type is highly efficient in terms of memory and running times. Arrays may be variable in the number of dimensions, form 1D-array, similar to a `list`; 2D-array, similar to a matrix or table; to a high n-dimensional array.\n",

As you may expect, some of the handy functions included in this library are limited by the type of data stored inside each array.\n",
