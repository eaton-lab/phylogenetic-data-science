# Coalescent trees


## Coalescent theory

In session 2.1 we learned that in an idealized population of finite 
fixed size (N) the effective population size ($N_e$) matches the census 
size, and predicts the rate of fixation (loss) of genetic diversity by 
genetic drift at a rate of 1 / 2$N_e$. 
In session 2.2, we saw that genealogical relationships among 
gene copies can arise as an outcome of the discrete time WF-process 
repeated over successive generations, and that the probability of coalescence
among random gene copies each generation is also 1 / 2$N_e$. 
The fact that both of these patterns occur at the same rate 
suggests a connection between genealogical patterns and genetic 
diversity in a population.

<!-- But what is the connection between
the genealogical history of gene copies in a population and the 
genetic diversity of a population?
 -->
<!-- In a random mating population of some fixed size, we can predict the 
rate of genetic drift based on the effective population size, $N_e$,

## Waiting times 

How long until N samples coalesce to a common ancestor? Before diving into
math let's start by using our simulation framework to get a feel for it.

## Statistical distributions

- Bernoulli trial
- Geometric distribution
- Exponential waiting time

<!-- Geometric Distribution is a discrete probability distribution and it expresses the probability distribution of the random variable (X) representing number of Bernoulli trials needed to get one success.
 -->
<!-- At each successive preceding generation, the probability of coalescence is geometrically distributed—that is, it is the probability of noncoalescence at the t − 1 preceding generations multiplied by the probability of coalescence at the generation of interest: 
 -->

<!-- ## Genealogies as random variables
We can simulate this process by randomly sampling gene copies to 
serve as parents of gene copies in successive generations.
This process can be repeated many times, from different starting seeds, 
and we would likely get a different outcome nearly every time, representing
*a random sample over the possible ways in which some number of gene 
copies could be related.* This turns out 

If we think of these genealogies as trees, rather than just a collection
of waiting times. 

... It can often be difficult at first to understand how a collection of
waiting times can represent a genealogy (tree). How does this process 
group samples together to form a tree from the waiting times? Randomly. 
Remember, random mating is fundamental to our model assumptions.
But how could a random tree possibly be useful compared to real data, 
where some samples will surely be more closely related than others most
of the time? ...

## Genetic variation on genealogies
Take note, this is not the probability that they
share a specific common ancestor in the previous generation, but rather 
a probability of whether or not they 
 -->


## Practical applications
Rather than keep track of every single gene 
copy in a large population, we can instead formulate expectations for 
how a small number of samples are expected to be related. It thus 
serves a practical purpose for both simulations and empirical studies
of populations.
