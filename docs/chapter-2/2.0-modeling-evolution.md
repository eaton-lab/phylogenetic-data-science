## Modeling evolution
The previous chapter introduced trees as a type of data structure,
discussing terminology and methods for using trees to understand
and describe evolutionary history. In this chapter we will turn our
focus to theoretical models underlying the case for treating evolution
as a tree-like process, spanning from the scale of molecules to the
entire tree of life.

Generally, when we think of phylogenetic trees it invokes an image of 
relationships among species, or perhaps even higher-level clades, such as 
taxonomic families or orders. At this scale, the labels at the tips of a
tree, such as *Diptera* or *Arecaceae*, are far-removed from the biological 
sample from which data was collected to infer the tree. In fact, this is 
very often the case. A label at the tip of a tree represents a hypothesis 
for the history of a **lineage** -- a theoretical concept *or model* for 
the idea of a cohesive population that has evolved through time. 
Thus, even when doing something as simple as reading a 
phylogeny, we are inherently making assumptions about a model of 
how populations evolve.
<!-- We can never sample every genome in a species,  -->
<!-- 
## Populations/Species
- Lineages are collections of individuals that ...
- A population exists at any point in time...

## Sampling
- We cannot sample everything, so few samples are used as representatives of lineages.
 -->

A less familiar type of phylogenetic tree is one that represents 
evolutionary relationships among the actual units of heritable 
information that descend from one generation to the next. At this scale
the tips of a phylogenetic tree *are in fact the biological samples for 
which the relationships are being depicted*. An example is a phylogeny
of *gene copies*, also called a *genealogy*.

## Gene copies 
As a diploid organism your genome exists in two copies, one inherited from
each of your two parents. These two copies are likely not identical, having 
accumulated mutations over time. Here the term *copy* is used somewhat 
confusingly to refer to the fact that these units can replicate themselves
and be inherited from one generation to the next. It is not a reference
to whether or not they share mutations. In a population of size N there will
exist 2N gene copies for any given gene. Here, similarly, the term *gene* 
is also somewhat misleading, since we do not actually care in this context
whether or not it is a coding or non-coding region of the genome. A gene 
copy can simply be thought of as a haploid region of a genome.


## Genealogies
A genealogy is a record of ancestor-descendant relationships. It is 
similar to a phylogenetic tree, and often modeled as one, but in reality
can include complex network-like relationships as well. Most people
are familiar with the concept of genealogy as it relates to tracing 
family trees. For example, a genealogy of your family would show that 
you are descended from your two parents (one generation back), and that
they are descended from your four grandparents (two generations back), 
and on and on. Your siblings, cousins, uncles/aunts, and other relatives
could be represented as well. This type of genealogy is a *genealogy of
individuals*, and although it can be similar to a *genealogy of gene copies*
at very short time scales, these two trees deviate significantly over time.
... The difference between a genetic and individual-level genealogy is 
detailed in a later chapter.

## Genetic genealogy
A genetic genealogy, in contrast to an individual-level genealogy, is a
genealogy of gene copies for some region of a genome. Although there exists
only one genealogy for you as an individual, your genome is composed of 
millions of distinct genealogies of gene copies. This is because each 
region of your genome can have a different genealogy from other regions, 
and even within a region, your two gene copies will trace back different 
histories. Each chromosome in an individual's genome is a *mosaic* of 
recombined segments from its many different ancestors.

For example, the two gene copies at gene A in an individual's genome may 
come, respectively, from its father's father, and mother's father (i.e.,
the individual's two grandfathers). At gene B, by contrast, the two copies 
came from its father's mother and mother's mother, respectively. Thus, 
no information from either of the individual's grandmothers is present at 
gene A, and no information from either of its grandfathers is present at 
gene B. *The gene copies at these two regions have different genealogical 
histories.*

This process continues backwards in time. The gene copies that exist
in each grandparent were also inherited from only a fraction of that 
grandparent's ancestors. In fact, the probability that one of an individual's 
ancestors continues to be one of its *genetic ancestors* -- by contributing at 
least some genetic material to its genome -- decreases rapidly with the 
number of generations back to that ancestor. ==References to some interesting 
papers, etc. on this topic.==

## Independent assortment
Even if we make the simplifiying assumption that recombination is absent, 
different chromosomes in a genome are still expected to have different 
genealogical histories, since each is inherited independently of the other.
For example, consider a diploid organism with two copies of chromosomes A 
and B, labeled (A1, A2, B1, and B2). When this organism forms haploid gametes
during reproduction, there is equal probability that a gamete will inherit
either copy of either chromosome, such that A1B1 is just as likely as 
A1B2, A2B1, or A2B2. This is called the law independent assortment.

Remember Mendel's pea experiments? Well, that's where this idea comes from.
The rule of *segregation and independent assortment* was not only an 
interesting experiment for understanding overdominance in the phenotypes of 
wrinkled peas, but rather, the fundamental finding of this work was that 
*genes get passed on to descendants as discrete units independently of one 
another*. This process turns out to be relevant to modeling genealogical 
relationships of gene copies, where the genealogy of gene copies at one 
gene in a genome can be completely independent of the genealogy for gene 
copies at different genes in the same diploid organism's genome. The 
distribution of different genealogies throughout a single genome, and among populations, is the focus of lessons in this chapter. 

<!-- 
In the absence of recombination a chromosome can represent a single 
*gene copy* -- a genetic unit that is inherited independantly of other 
genetic units (other chromosomes copies) by its offspring. When 
recombination does occur, however, a chromosome is subdivided by crossover 
events, such that smaller blocks of one genome are recombined with another, 
in which case each non-recombined block of the chromosome represents a 
gene copy. Perhaps the most fitting description of a
gene copy is something for which multiple copies can trace back a 
genealogy without recombination...? -->


## Nested hierarchy
- A genealogy represents a special type of phylogenetic tree.
- Evolutionary relationships exist in a nested hierarchy. 
	- haplotype genealogy nested within individual genealogies
	- ind genealogies nested within population/species trees.
- Higher-level phylogenetic trees are a model for the expected 
distribution of genealogical trees...


## Inference and Truth
- A true genealogical history exists, but cannot be perfectly inferred.
