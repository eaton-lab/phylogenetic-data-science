    "Your assigned reading quotes the philosopher of science Robert O'Hara who stated, \"*It is impossible to really understand evolution without an ability to accurately interpret phylogenetic trees*\", and that \"*evolution itself is a theory of evolutionary trees*\" (O'Hara 1988, 1997). In biology generally, and in this book already, you have seen many examples of phylogenetic trees. But what does a phylogenetic tree represent? And why is it important to understand? There are actually several common pitfalls that most beginners make when interpreting phylogenetic trees, and that even practiced biologists often commit as well. Recognizing and avoiding these mistakes will make you a better biologist."

    "### Phylogenetic trees\n",
    "A phylogenetic tree is a hypothesis of the inferred evolutionary relationships among a set of samples; the units represented at the tips. Sometimes, when we have fossil or ancient DNA data, we may have additional information about ancestral (internal) nodes in a tree. At the extreme, we may even have historical samples that are direct ancestors of later samples, such as in experimental evolution studies. However, regardless of the information that is used to infer a phylogeny, it remains a hypothesis. It is an attempt to describe a model of how a set of samples are related through evolutionary history.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we interact with phylogenetic trees most frequently is as images. Most people have seen a phylogeny in a museum, or television program, or in the news. Phylogenies are ubiquitous throughout biology, where they are used to describe the relationships among species, populations, individuals (genealogies), genes, and gene copies. However, not all tree diagrams are phylogenies. Many other types of hierarchically structured data can also be visualized as trees, but often with a very different interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phylogenetic trees are distinct in that they are explicitly intended to represent evolution. This has consequence for how internal nodes in phylogenetic trees should be interpreted (as common ancestors), for the directionality in which they should read (root-to-tip, or vice versa), and for the types of relationships and information that can be extracted (i.e., how to describe evolutionary relationships)."

    "\n",

At its minimum, a phylogenetic tree represents a set of ancestor-descendant relationships. In addition, it may include information such as edge lengths that describe the magnitude of divergence between sets of samples. It may also include probabilities or weights as measures of confidence or support for the relationships. Many additional types of information can be contained in a phylogenetic tree that together represent a rich description of evolution, and often relate to parameters of the statistical inference method that was used to infer the phylogeny.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to start to understand phylogenies as a type of data, as opposed to simply a drawing, is to explore the use of trees as data objects.

However, if the tree topology *is changed* then the internal node numbering will change as well.

    "Earlier I mentioned that we would assume the tree was rooted, we'll now dive deeper into what that means. A phylogenetic tree can be rooted or unrooted, which indicates whether or not *we know* the direction of evolution on the tree, i.e., which node is the root (common ancestor to all samples the tree).\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that most of the methods that we have for inferring phylogenetic trees are only able to infer an unrooted tree, and rely on additional evidence afterwards to identify the rooting. As an example, consider a data set composed of morphological measurements on many different mammals that are using to infer a phylogeny using the method of parsimony. This would involve proposing a phylogenetic tree hypothesis, and then counting how many evolutionary *changes* of each character are required to explain the observed trait data at the tips of the tree. Because we simply count the number of *changes*, it is not required for us to know whether each change represents a gain or a loss of each character. This turns out to be a strength of many phylogenetic inference methods, they can yield a tree hypothesis without requiring knowledge of the rooting of a tree. However, as evolutionary biologists, we *do* want to know how a tree should be rooted. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the most frequent solution is to use an *outgroup*. That is to say, we include a sample in the phylogenetic analysis that we *know* (strongly believe) is more distantly related all of the other samples. Such information may come from alternative data (DNA versus morphology), previous analyses, from fossils, or other sources. With an outgroup decided, and using the unrooted tree that we inferred, we can then root the tree by inserting a Node on the branch between the ingroup and outgroup samples, since we know that they must all share a MRCA together. Let's walk through this process visually to better understand it."

Generally, though, we refer to both as phylogenies and simply label the axes and figure legends to describe what they represent. "
