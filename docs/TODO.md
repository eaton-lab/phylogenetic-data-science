### Priorities

- 1.5
	- make a simple traversal chapter for readers who are not getting so deep into coding yet.
	- describe that Nodes are useful as data storage objects.

- 1.7
	- show Node() reprs in Indexable class section.
	- put iterable class before indexable class.
	- make line numbered sections w/ highlight to describe update func.
	- demonstrate get functions.
	- demonstrate scatterplot and line plotting to make a tree.

- Substitution Models Animations
	- Create a toytree function to generate likelihood models as cirlces
	with lines connecting them, and optional animation of ball bouncing 
	between states. This can be created using keyframes by custom editing
	of the css post toyplot, similar to the traversal algorithms. This could
	be coded in a utils animation subpackage.

- 6.1
	- Move pandas versus numpy speed comparison to bootcamp and link to
	it in this tutorial.
	- At end, use the
